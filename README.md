Let's build a game!

1. 🍴 Fork this repo to your own GitHub account (if you haven't done so already)
2. 🐑 After cloning to your local machine, install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. 🚀 Start it up! `npm start` will start a server running at http://localhost:8080. Head on over there in your browser, and navigate to the 'public/' directory, which is where the Phaser application is served.
